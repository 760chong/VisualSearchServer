**As of Jan 2017 I am now developing Deep Video Analytics. It provides a more complete set of functionality for video and image analytics (such as uploads, async processing, docker-compose etc.) in addition to all the features provided by this repository. You can find the [Deep Video Analytics repo here](https://github.com/akshayubhat/DeepVideoAnalytics).**
